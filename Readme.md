# DMZ-Black-96dpi

This is DMZ-Black, but only with the 96 dpi (24x24) version. This is to bypass the stupid huge cursor thing that happens on some distros if you have a big resolution monitor. (Where even `Xcursor.side: 24` doesn't seem to do anything helpful.)

To install, simply run `sudo ./install.sh` and it will make and install the cursor theme, and after that run `change_cursor.sh` for you.
